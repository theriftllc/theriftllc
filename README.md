**`ServiceNow Solution Architect`**

I'm a Solution Architect and ServiceNow Specialist, creating impactful solutions that solve real-world problems. I've built a variety of robust applications from the ground up, from planning and designing to implementation and deployment.

My most enriching project yet was the ServiceNow app I've built to track my progress as I cycled 100 miles to raise funds for the ❤️ American Heart Association.
