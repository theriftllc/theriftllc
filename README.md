**`ServiceNow Solution Architect`**

I'm a Solution Architect and ServiceNow Specialist, creating impactful solutions. I've built a variety of  applications from the ground up that solve real-world problems, from planning and designing to implementation and deployment.

My most enriching project yet was the ServiceNow app I've built to track my progress as I cycle 100 miles in june to raise funds for the ‚ù§Ô∏è American Heart Association. My dad and my wifes father both had this illness, so this project was close to my ‚ù§Ô∏è.
