## My Journey ðŸŒ±
The beginning of my public project journey started with a cause very close to my heart. To raise funds for the American Heart Association, I embarked on a mission to cycle 100 miles. But as a passionate tech enthusiast, I knew just cycling wouldn't be enough.

## Featured Project: American Heart Association Fundraiser

As the first of my publicly available projects, I created a ServiceNow application to track my cycling progress over 100 miles. The app served to add a layer of transparency, enabling donors to follow my progress live and see their funds being actively put to use. The project was not only a testament to my resolve for a noble cause but an example of how technology can be leveraged for socially beneficial purposes.
